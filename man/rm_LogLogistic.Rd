\title{Log-logistic response model}
\usage{
rm_LogLogistic(x, b, c, d, e)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of x values.}

\item{b}{A numeric value representing the steepness of the curve.}

\item{c}{A numeric value representing the lower asymptote.}

\item{d}{A numeric value representing the upper asymptote.}

\item{e}{A numeric value representing the x-value of the sigmoid's midpoint.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as x, representing the computed log-logistic response values.
}
\description{
This function computes the log-logistic response model for a given vector of x values.
It takes parameters b, c, d, and e to define the log-logistic function.
}
\details{
The log-logistic function is defined as:
\deqn{y = c + \frac{(d - c)}{1 + e^{-b(log(x) - log(e))}}}
}
\examples{
x_values <- seq(0, 10, by = 0.1)
b <- -2
c <- 0
d <- 1
e <- 5
result <- rm_LogLogistic(x_values, b, c, d, e)
plot(x_values, result, type = "l", main = "Log-logistic Response Model", xlab = "x", ylab = "y")
}
